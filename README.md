# Stock-Market-Real-Time-Data-Analysis-Using-Kafka

My Notion note link of the project: 
https://magical-xylophone-f23.notion.site/Stock-Market-Real-Time-Data-Analysis-Using-Kafka-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project-1-9d9ab4142bc54b83aa09f438af18871d


The stock market dataset is not real , most of it is random since we only work on the engineering/buidling side of it and you wont see any visualization of a stockmarket


I made it detailed as much as possible and went through it in detail so errors could be avoided as much as possible for future readers
Its also 98% completed , the last 2% was to show case the columns and rows on aws athena but the SQL command line wasnt working for me .


I dont have a job , nor a mentor so i did this as a beginner myself with some youtube videos along with chatgpt to help me out . So i think even if you are new to data engineering , executing this project as a newbie should help you , even if you dont understand most of the stuff like the code or the command lines  , you just need to know what it does generally speaking(if that makes sense), like driving a car , you dont need to know how the steering wheel works behind the scnes , just steer the car left or/and right . Or ask chatgpt to explain these concepts to you like a layman . Execution helps ALOT

Also i did this project without a cause , but it was a blessing in disguise to help me understand AWS better since im perusing to take the AWS CSA certification . It doest have everything related to aws , but it did motivated me persue for an aws certificate 
No need to write your own notes , i wrote it for you , just follow the steps and execute it

I kindly request to credit me if your going to showcase this anywhere(yt , blogpost , elonmusk , your dog  etc) , it took alot of time time then it should .
Happy Learning
